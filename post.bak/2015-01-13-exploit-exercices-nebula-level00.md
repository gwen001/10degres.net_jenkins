[Nebula](https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/ "Exploit Exercises, Nebula"){:class="flashlink" target="_blank"} is part of Exploit Exercises, 
it covers a variety of simple and intermediate challenges that cover Linux privilege escalation, common scripting language issues, and file system race conditions.

> This level requires you to find a Set User ID program that will run as the “flag00” account. 
You could also find this by carefully looking in top level directories in / for suspicious looking directories.
Alternatively, look at the find man page.

In this first level, you have to find a file owned by `flag00` with suid bit. 
A single command can do the trick:

```bash
find / -user flag00 -perm /6000
```

<!--more-->

Alternatively you can use `-uid 999` where `999` is the user id of `flag00` which can be found in `/etc/passwd`. 
This outputs the same result:

```bash
find / -user 999 -perm -u+s
```

`/bin/.../flag00` is the key. 
When you run it you become another user due to the suid. 
Here is the POC:

The redirection is only used to avoid the errors triggered by the system when you try to read a forbidden directory.
